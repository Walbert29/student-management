## üìö Project Organization

The development of the project follows a layer-based architecture. The code is organized as follows:

- `src/`: Where the main source code of the project is stored.
  - `controllers/`: Directory where input requests are processed.
  - `crud/`: Organize, store, and execute database operations.
  - `database/`: Directory where database connections are controlled.
  - `enums/`: Define the limited sets of options or states that can be used.
  - `models/`: The data structures that represent entities in the application are defined.
  - `schemas/`: Directory used to define the structure, validation and serialization of the data.
  - `services/`: Directory where the business logic is grouped and processed.
  - `main.py`: Main entry point.
  - `settings.py`: File where the microservice configurations are managed.
- `test/`:Where the project tests are executed.
- `.gitignore/`: Specify which files should be ignored by Git.
- `README.md/`: Provides information and documentation about the project.
- `requirements.txt/`: Used to specify project dependencies.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Fast configuration and execution.

1. Clone this repository
   ```bash
   https://github.com/Walbert29/student-management.git
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment

   **Linux:**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

   **Windows:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the dependencies

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Start the server

   **Using the main entry point:**

   ```bash
   cd src/
   python main.py
   ```

5. Download the template designed for student enrollment

   ```bash
